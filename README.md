Management software for monitoring and controlling the transactions in a library .The project ‚ÄúLibrary Management System‚Äù is developed by C#, which mainly focuses on basic operations in a library like borrow/return book, adding new books, and updating new information, searching books and members.

This project of ‚ÄúLIBRARY MANAGEMENT‚Äù of gives us the complete information about the library. We can enter the record of new books and retrieve the details of books available in the library. We can issue the books to the students and maintain their records and can also check how many books are issued and stock available in the library. In this project we can maintain the late fine of students who returns the issued books after the due date.

### Functionalities

* The borrower can borrow the books by bring id of the book they want to borrow to librarian. 
* The librarian will check if it is the expected borrower. The librarian will then take the reserved copy and loan it out to the borrower.
* The id of each book to be borrowed is then keyed into the machine. The status of each copy indicates it is available, can borrow or not. Only the available copy is allowed to be borrowed. A 2 week loan period is allowed per book. A referenced or borrowed copy is not allowed to be borrowed. If the copies to be borrowed are all available, the copy number, book name, borrow date and expected return date is used for confirmation
